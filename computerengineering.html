    <h1> You got Computer Science! </h1>

    <p>
        Where computer science is mostly focused on the software side of computers a Computer Engineer would focus on the hardware. The study of computer engineering revolves 
        around understanding how the components in a computer are layed out and how they relate to each other. This can also cover things like what processors do each clock cycle 
        and how to lay out their instructions. There is a large focius on digital logic devices as the is the buildiong block of computers. Computer Engineers lie somewhere between computer 
        and electrical engineering and need skills from both. This also allows them to do many jobs that reach into these fields as well.
